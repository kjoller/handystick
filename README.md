HandyStick is yet another small development board with an AtmegaX8 (Atmega88,
Atmega168, Atmega328). The board is targeted towards use with vUsb, a software
implemented USB stack.

It is cheap to manufacture, fitting two on a cheap 5x5cm 2-layer pcb, and using
easy-to-source parts.

Possible uses:

* Using projects like USBAspLoader, you can get a USB programmable AVR board for less than $3 in parts.
* You can use this for USB HID-devices, such as joysticks, gamepads or even a full-featured MAME cabinet
* USB dataloggers
* For more ideas, see the vUSB web site.

The first panel is panelised with mouse bites (tab routing), so not all PCB
services will take it. I have ordered the first batch on DirtyPCBs. 

(For added vendor flexibility, it would be wise to panelize it using only
silkscreen seperators. with just silkscreen, 5 should fit easily on a 5x10cm
board, making it even cheaper.)
